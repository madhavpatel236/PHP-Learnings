## Task-8


Start by creating a base class called Employee with the following details:

name (string)
age (integer)
salary (decimal number)
A method display_details() that prints out the employeeâ€™s info.
Create two more specialized employee types:

Manager (inherits from Employee and has an extra attribute bonus).
Developer (inherits from Employee and has an extra attribute programming_language).
Use encapsulation:

Make the salary private (so it can't be accessed directly).
Use getter and setter methods to update and fetch the salary safely.

Create Manager and Developer objects.
Print their details using display_details().
Update the salary using the setter method and print again.

Please Submit: A working script that shows how OOP makes managing employee data structured and reusable.
